                               The Hue SDK is a set of tools that are designed to make it easy to access
                               the Hue system through the Hue Wi-Fi network connected bridge and control
                               an associated set of connected lamps. The aim of the SDK is to enable you
                               to create your own applications for the Hue system. The tools are provided
                               with documentation for the SDK and example code. They are designed to be
                               flexible, whilst easing the use of the more complex components of the system.

                               Philips releases this SDK with friendly house rules. These friendly house rules
                               are part of a legal framework; this to protect both the developers and hue.
                               The friendly house rules cover e.g. the naming of Philips and of hue which can
                               only be used as a reference (a true and honest statement) and not as a an brand
                               or identity. Also covered is that the hue SDK and API can only be used for hue
                               and for no other application or product. Very common sense friendly rules that
                               are common practice amongst leading brands that have released their SDKâ€™s.
