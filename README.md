The hue Apple SDK by Philips
===============
(c) Copyright Philips 2012-2014
Introduction
----------------
The Hue SDK is a set of tools that are designed to make it easy to access the Hue system through the Hue Wi-Fi network connected bridge and control an associated set of connected lamps. The aim of the SDK is to enable you to create your own applications for the Hue system.
The tools are provided with documentation for the SDK and example code. They are designed to be flexible, whilst easing the use of the more complex components of the system.

Supported platforms
----------------
The hue Apple SDK provides an Objective C API to access the hue system and is available and supported on the following platforms:

* iOS platform SDK
 * Supported from iOS 5.0 and higher
* OS X platform SDK
 * Supported from OS X 10.7 and higher

Get Started
----------------
To get started programming with the hue Apple SDK there are 2 main approaches you can take:

### Integrate the SDK into an existing or new project
Depending on your choice of platform, use either    _HueSDK\_iOS.framework_ or the _HueSDK\_OSX.framework_ folder from this repository.

After downloading, drag the framework folder to your Xcode project and add ‘-ObjC’ to your linker flags under your project Build Settings.
Next download the files from the Lumberjack folder from this repository and add them to your project.

### Use our QuickStart app as your base
Our QuickStart app is a bare bones application with minimal code for connecting and authenticating to a bridge and updating a lightstate. A good starting point for creating your own app.  Depending on your choice of platform, use either the project available in the _QuickStart iOS_ or the  _QuickStart OS X_ folder from this repository.

Acknowledgements
----------------
Please adhere to any third party licenses that are applicable on this SDK when building applications with our SDK or using the QuickStart applications as your base (see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file in this repository, for applicable licenses).

Swift Integration
----------------
To start using the hue Apple SDK in your Swift projects:

* Add a new file to your project, an Objective-C .m file.
* When asked about creating a bridge header file, say yes.
* Remove the unused .m file you just added.

* Add your Objective-C import statements to the created bridge header .h file, like for using the hue Apple SDK:
 * For iOS:
<pre>#import &lt;HueSDK\_iOS/HueSDK.h></pre>
 * For OS X:
<pre>#import &lt;HueSDK\_OSX/HueSDK.h></pre>

Once you’ve added the hue Apple SDK to your bridge header, you can start using the SDK in your Swift project.

Disclaimer
----------------
Philips releases this SDK with friendly house rules. These friendly house rules are part of a legal framework; this to protect both the developers and hue. The friendly house rules cover e.g. the naming of Philips and of hue which can only be used as a reference (a true and honest statement) and not as a an brand or identity. Also covered is that the hue SDK and API can only be used for hue and for no other application or product. Very common sense friendly rules that are common practice amongst leading brands that have released their SDK’s.
